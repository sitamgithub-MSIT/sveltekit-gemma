# Sveltekit-Hugging Face

This SvelteKit project makes use of Hugging Face inference providers in OpenAI-compatible mode to access various models. It serves as a simple example of how to utilize these inference providers alongside the Vercel AI SDK to create a chatbot that interacts with a large language model. The project is based on Daytona's starter AI chatbot initiative.
